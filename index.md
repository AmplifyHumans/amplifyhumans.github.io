# Amplify Humans: Building AI Companions

### Introduction

Rapid advancements of foundation models over the past two years has showcased transformative potential of Generative AI (GenAI) in human creativity, workflow automation, and reasoning.

AI companions represent the next frontier in human-AI collaboration. Yet, most current solutions rely on manual, limited context entry and offer only short-lived, fragmented workflows. Opaque decision-making mechanics further compound user distrust, since individuals lack visibility into how the AI arrives at conclusions.

Amplify Humans envisions a future where AI becomes a seamless extension of human abilities, not just tools, but lifelong personal companions that understand, adapt, and evolve with users. These companions learn from and integrate into both personal and professional ecosystems, providing proactive assistance and redefining human potential through meaningful interactions and trust.
