# Amplify Humans: Building Open-Source AI Companions

## Introduction

Rapid advancements in foundation models have reshaped creativity, automation, and reasoning. However, most AI companions still rely on manually entered, limited context and offer short-lived, fragmented interactions. Opaque decision-making processes further erode user trust, as individuals have little insight into how these systems arrive at conclusions. Amplify Humans envisions a future where AI functions as an adaptable, lifelong companionâ€”learning from personal and professional data to deliver proactive, trustworthy assistance.

## Core Pillars

### 1. Flowing Context and Long-Term Memory
Amplify Humans supports AI companions with continuously updated user context, allowing them to recall past interactions without repeated prompts. By dynamically drawing on past and present data, these systems deliver more relevant insights.

### 2. Learning and Adaptation
Companions evolve by linking new insights to historical data, enabling increasingly relevant and proactive recommendations. They anticipate user actions, refine suggestions, and improve over time.

### 3. Invisible UI
Rather than relying on explicit prompts, AI functionalities operate seamlessly in everyday platformsâ€”Slack, Jira, or emailâ€”reducing cognitive overhead and enabling natural human-AI collaboration.

### 4. Communications Protocol Among Agents
A unified messaging protocol enables specialized AI agents to share tasks, context, and conflict data. Standard message types (requests, updates, responses) ensure traceability while reducing contradictory directives.

### 5. Decentralized AI, Trust, and Responsibility
Users retain data ownership, storing it locally or in federated environments. Ethical guidelines and regulatory standards, such as GDPR, protect user information and guide system actions, promoting both transparency and accountability.

## Open-Source Platform

Amplify Humans is an open-source platform that provides a modular ecosystem for building, training, and deploying AI companions. Developers can extend memory models, improve conflict resolution methods, and integrate workflows spanning diverse domains. Inspired by frameworks like Terraform, GitLab, and LangChain, the platform facilitates community experimentation and supports both mainstream and specialized needs.

By integrating AI libraries (Hugging Face, OpenAI) and orchestration frameworks (LangChain, AutoGen), Amplify Humans delivers a unified architecture to streamline AI companion development. The goal is to encourage proactive, collaborative behaviors across multiple agents while maintaining user trust.

## Architecture

This architecture incorporates distinct layers for memory, reasoning, interaction, and security. A Flowing Context Module maintains evolving user preferences, while the Learning and Adaptation Engine refines its recommendations based on real-world feedback. An Invisible UI layer integrates AI into existing workflows, and an Ethical & Trust Layer ensures compliance with data protection standards. Multi-agent communication protocols govern coordination between specialized agents, preventing duplication and contradictions.

## Project Roadmap

- **Milestone 1**: Establish the core components for memory and basic interactions.
- **Milestone 2**: Introduce multi-agent communications and conflict resolution protocols.
- **Milestone 3**: Expand into federated learning, advanced integration, and user-friendly tooling.
